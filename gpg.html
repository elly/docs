<p><em>Before using this guide, you may want to read <a href="crypto.html>">the
crypto primer</a>.</em></p>

<p>
A gpg key can serve two purposes: <span class="term">confidentiality</span> and
<span class="term">authentication</span>.  Confidentiality means that nobody
other than the intended recipient can read the message; authentication means the
message provably came from the supposed source. <span
class="term">Encryption</span> is used to ensure confidentiality and <span
class="term">signing</span> is used to ensure authentication.
</p>
<p>
First, you will need a key:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --gen-key
</code></p>

<p>
You will be prompted for a key type; choose the default. A key size of 2048 or
4096 bits is probably safe. You will probably want your key not to expire, at
least at first, so choose '0' for no expiry time. Now enter a real name, email
address, and comment; these are visible to everyone and form your key's
human-friendly name. Choose a passphrase. <em>Do not</em> use a passphrase you
have used anywhere else. Anyone with this passphrase and access to the file your
key is stored in can use it to read messages encrypted to you and forge
authenticated messages from you.
</p>

<p>
gpg may ask you for more entropy; if so, just use your machine normally and wait
while it gathers it. gpg will then emit a few lines like this:
</p>

<p><pre>
    pub   2048R/12345678 &lt;date&gt;
          key fingerprint = A4CF D9E3 9018 E254 67F7  99D9 2D76 F7F2 1234 5678
    uid                  Your Name (Your Comment) &lt;your@email.net&gt;
    sub   2048R/9ABCDEF0 &lt;date&gt;
</pre></p>

<p>
The number after '2048R' (or 4096R if you made a 4096-bit key) is your key id.
This is a short number useful for looking up a key in a relatively unambiguous
way. You can find it out again with:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --list-keys your@email.net
</code></p>

<p>
You can see all the keys gpg knows about by just not specifying an email
address there. Now you'll want to upload your key to a keyserver so that other
people can easily fetch it:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --send-keys 12345678
</code></p>

<p>
Now suppose that you have met a person (in meatspace or some other secure
channel) and you wish to get their key and verify it for later use. They will
say to you "my key ID is 84736251", for example, and you can fetch their key:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --recv-keys 84736251
</code></p>

<p>
However, you have no assurance that the key was not tampered with either in
transit or on the key server. In order to make sure it wasn't, you need to check
the fingerprint of the key, which is a cryptographic checksum. You can find the
fingerprint for a key with:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --fingerprint --list-keys 84736251
</code></p>

<p>
You and the person whose key it is should both run that command, then compare
the listed key fingerprints. If they match, the key has not been tampered with
and can be used. You can indicate that you believe the key is valid by signing
it. By signing a key you certify that that key belongs to the owner of the
listed email address. You can sign your friend's key like this:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --sign-key 84736251
</code></p>

<p>
You will be prompted to confirm that you really mean to sign the key. Signing a
key indicates that to the best of your knowledge, the owner of that key is also
the owner of that email address. Signing keys is <em>crucially important</em> for
allowing people who have not met in person to nonetheless communicate securely.
</p>

<p>
Once you have signed their key, you can upload your signature by sending their
key:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --send-key 84736251
</code></p>

<p>
From now on, anyone who receives that key (using --recv-key) will have your
signature of authenticity attached to it. You can test that your signature is
there:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --list-sigs 84736251
</code></p>

<p>
Now you and your friend have exchanged keys and are ready to send encrypted,
signed email to each other. Write a message to your friend and save it in a file
called 'message'. Now run:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --sign --encrypt --armor --recipient 84736251 message
</code></p>

<p>
You will be prompted for your passphrase, and then gpg will generate a file
called 'message.asc' in the current directory. This is the encrypted signed
message. Your friend can now decrypt the message:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --decrypt message.asc
</code></p>

<p>
This will emit the decrypted message to your terminal. If you want to save it to
a file, use the --output option:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --output somefile --decrypt message.asc
</code></p>

<p>
In both cases, they will be prompted for their passphrase to decrypt the
message. Now they can reply to you:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --sign --encrypt --armor --recipient 12345678 othermessage
</code></p>

<p>
And you can decrypt their reply:
</p>

<p><code>
  gpg --decrypt othermessage.asc
</code></p>

<p>
Good luck :)
